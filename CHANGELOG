Release 2.0

Enhancements:
    - new configuration file syntax, offering significant improvements.
    - the ability to define listener-specific back-ends. In most cases
      this should eliminate the need for multiple Pound instances.
    - a new type of back-end: the redirector allows you to respond with
      a redirect without involving any back-end server.
    - most "secondary" properties (such as error messages, client
      time-out, etc.) are now private to listeners.
    - HAport has an optional address, different from the main back-end
    - added a -V flag for version
    - session keeping on a specific Header
